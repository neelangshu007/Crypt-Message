# Crypt-Message

Crypt-Message is an Android Application that can Encrypt and Decrypt a message using the Encoding and Decoding algorithm respectively. The appâ€™s homepage will give the user two option:

Encryption: It is the process of transforming a readable message into an unreadable one. To do so we use encoding algorithms.

Decryption: It is the process of transforming data or information from an unreadable to readable form. To do so we use decoding algorithms


## Custom Feature
* On Long click on 'ENCRYPT BUTTON' in 'ENCRYPTION Activity' a custom encrytption algorithm will be used in the backend to change your text into binary code which will be more secure
* And to DECRYPT that binary code into normal text you have to Long click on the 'DECRYPT BUTTON' in "DECRYPTION Activity'
