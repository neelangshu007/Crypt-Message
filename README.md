# Crypt-Message

Crypt-Message is an Android Application that can Encrypt and Decrypt a message using the Encoding and Decoding algorithm respectively. The appâ€™s homepage will give the user two option:

Encryption: It is the process of transforming a readable message into an unreadable one. To do so we use encoding algorithms.
Decryption: It is the process of transforming data or information from an unreadable to readable form. To do so we use decoding algorithms.
